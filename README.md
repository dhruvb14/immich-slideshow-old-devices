# Immich Slideshow for old Devices with Management UI

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For versions of Immich prior to 3.x, use version 1.x of Immich Slideshow for old Devices.

I added some stuff to this repo in order to get it working with the Fully Kiosk Browser on a Nixplay w10a. Generally this should work on tablets with android 19 (4.4). The main slideshow is is at the root URL while the management is done at /management.php. The tablet itself is running fully kiosk's browser, and Tasker to reboot the browser upon reboot/crash.

A simple PHP-based slideshow application for Immich album photos, designed to work on older devices and browsers (iOS 9, old Android, ECMAScript 2009...). It displays photos from a specified Immich album in a full-screen slideshow format.

One day I decided to dust off two old iPads I had in a drawer (an iPad 2 and an iPad mini) to use them as digital photo frames, so my parents could see their granddaughter's photos from an album of my Immich instance.

I searched for projects already created for this purpose and found the great [Immich Kiosk](https://github.com/damongolding/immich-kiosk), it's a good project but it doesn't work on such old devices, so I decided to create a simple alternative but that works on older browsers and devices.

> [!NOTE]
> If your device supports [Immich Kiosk](https://github.com/damongolding/immich-kiosk), maybe you should use it before this project.
